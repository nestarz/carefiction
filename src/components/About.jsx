      <p>
        <i>Care Fiction</i> is the prototype of a playground for collaborative
        dreaming, envisioning, conceiving, projecting. It all starts with a
        targeted resource, or commons. We invite our guests to react to an
        existing value, by pouring their ideas, resources, scenarios, inside the
        container.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our generative fiction tool will combine all contributions and produce
        an ever changing story. The more we all add, the more the story becomes
        richer, and selected. May the dream breach through the screen and become
        real.
