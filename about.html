          Care Fiction is a project developed during <i>Stigmergy</i>, the 2020
          research seminar led by Martina Muzi at Design Academy Eindhoven.
          <br />
          Invited to think at the intersection of the broad phenomena of
          self-organized systems and the notion of care, we, a group of three
          master students with a shared interest in the digital and urban
          Commons, built a thinking toy for commoning co-fabulation. It is a
          decentralized peer-to-peer website where anonimous visitors are
          invited to co-write and sketch a commoning story around an abandoned
          building in Eindhoven.<br />
          <br />
          Through playful exercise and experimentation, it aims at laying the
          imaginative foundation for future Commons. By bringing to the
          foreground the phase 0 of every collective enterprise—the dreaming
          stage—it provides a space for rehearsal of commoning, envisioning and
          projecting. It aims at raising questions regarding the care of public
          and not-so-public spaces and resources in the city.<br />
